# semantic-html

A project to clean up semantic tags within the Horiseon marketing agency website. 

## Project Description

Horiseon marketing agency requested a review of the website HTML and CSS code. This project aims at streamlining the code, and updating semantic tags within the HTML code. A challenge that was faced included learning new semantic tags to implement. Some features to be included in the future would be more information in each paragraph, contact information links, and add testimonials from clients.
